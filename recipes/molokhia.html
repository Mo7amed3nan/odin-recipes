    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Molokhia is the name of both a leafy green vegetable (jute mallow or Jew's mallow) and the nutrient-dense stew made from it, which is considered an iconic dish in Egypt and popular throughout the Middle East and North Africa. The dish's name is thought to come from an Arabic word for "royal" and its origins are traced to ancient Egypt, where it was once believed to be a food reserved for royalty or even a curative remedy for pharaohs. Molokhia's distinctive characteristic is its mucilaginous, or "slimy," texture that develops when the leaves are minced and cooked, similar to okra, while its flavor is earthy and can be likened to spinach or collard greens. It is typically prepared by simmering the minced leaves in a rich broth—often chicken, beef, or rabbit—and finished with a fragrant mixture of sautéed garlic and coriander, known as the ta'aliya or adka. The comforting stew is commonly served alongside white rice or with pita bread and is celebrated as a beloved meal in many households and restaurants.</p>
    
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> <strong>Jute mallow leaves </strong> : The main ingredient, which gives the dish its name and unique texture. The leaves can be used fresh, dried, or frozen.</li>
        <li> <strong>Broth</strong> : Typically chicken broth is used to cook the leaves, though beef or vegetable broth can also be used.</li>
        <li> <strong>Garlic</strong> : A large amount of minced garlic is sauteed, often with coriander, to create a flavor base known as "tasha" or "adha".</li>
        <li> <strong>Ground coriander</strong>: This spice is toasted with the garlic to add an earthy, warm flavor and fragrant aroma to the dish.</li>
        <li> <strong>Ghee or butter</strong> :  This fat is used to fry the garlic and coriander for the flavor-infusing garnish.</li>
        <li> <strong>Lemon juice</strong> : Often added at the end for a bright, tangy finish and to balance the other flavors.</li>
        <li> <strong>Salt and pepper</strong> : Seasonings are added to taste throughout the cooking process. </li>
    </ul>
